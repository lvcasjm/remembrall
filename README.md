# Remembrall

A CLI tool for recording consumed media, built in Rust.

## Disclaimer

I built this tool for myself, for a couple of reasons:
- I wanted to keep track of the media I was consuming, It's fun to look back on.
- I wanted an excuse to learn Rust.

With the above in mind, The only reason this is open source is because I enjoyed
building it and I figure that if someone else wants to use it then why not.
